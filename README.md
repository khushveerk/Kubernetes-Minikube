# Kubernetes (K8S)
- It is an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
-  It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

**Key features of Kubernetes include**:
1. Container Management: Simplifies running and managing containers across clusters.
2. Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of active containers based on demand.
3. Load Balancing: Distributes traffic to ensure no single container is overwhelmed.
4. Self-healing: Automatically restarts failed containers and replaces or reschedules them as needed.
5. Service Discovery: Allows containers to communicate with each other and external services seamlessly.
6. Configuration Management: Manages application configuration and secrets securely.
